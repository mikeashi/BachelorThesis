\section{Automated Planning}

The term \textbf{Planning} is commonly used to describe the act of 
scheduling. However, planning can mean much more than just
scheduling; for example, the Cambridge Dictionary defines 
it as the act of deciding how to do something\footnote{\url{https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/planning}}, 
which is a better definition to use in the context of intelligent agents that 
use planning to decide how to achieve their goals. The notion of intelligent agents entails the ability to observe and interact 
with the environment in a deliberate mater to achieve some objective. 
However, to act deliberately, the agent has to have a clear objective 
and be able to predict the effect of its actions in a given state of 
the environment. Furthermore, some objectives are inherently complex, and to accomplish them, 
the agent has to decide which actions to perform and in which order to execute 
them. This reasoning process of choosing actions and organizing them 
is called planning \cite{AutomatedPlanningTheoryghallab2006}. 
Automated planning can be described as the study of computational models and methods 
of creating, analyzing, managing, and 
executing plans \cite{IntroductionPlanningDomainhaslum2019}.
