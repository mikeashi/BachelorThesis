# AI Planning for Poker Player
The game of poker is interesting in that it combines elements of stochasticity, reasoning, risk awareness, opponent modeling, and decision making with hidden information. The goal of this project is to study components that are necessary to build a successful AI poker player. Most notably:

1) HTN Planning techniques that include risk-awareness

2) Accurate opponent modeling based on game hand history

3) Dynamic evaluation of the current state of the game based on hand history, stack values, and position

4) Adaptation of strategies to type of game played (number of tables, speed, limits, etc.)

The case study will be online No-Limit Hold 'em Multi-Table Tournaments.
